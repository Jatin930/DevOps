# In this project, I took the famous 2048 game and containerized it using Docker. I then deployed it to Elastic Beanstalk on AWS.

## Things I learned during this project:

### _Docker_
* Creating Dockerfile
* Docker commands
* Creating a Docker image and Container

### _AWS_
* Create an Environment and Appication using Elastic Beanstalk
* Deploy application using Elastic Beanstalk
* Create IAM roles and give them certain permissions
* Configured and then launched an EC2 Instance

### You can use follwing URL to see the 2048 that I have deployed:
### http://jatins2048container.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

**(Keep in mind that the above URL is not going to be available forever because I have a limited AWS account.)**
