# In this project, I took the famous 2048 game and containerized it using Docker. I then deployed it to Elastic Beanstalk on AWS.

## Things I learned during this project:
* How to create Docker file and then use that to run commands and create a Docker image and container
* Use Elastic Beanstalk service on AWS and deploy this application. 
* created IAM roles and gave it certain permissions
* created an environment and appication using Elastic Beanstalk
* Launched an instance using ec2 service


### You can use follwing URL to see the 2048 that I have deployed: http://jatins2048container.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/
**(Keep in mind that the above URL is not going to be available forever because I have a limited AWS account.)**
